In the dirb result we found some url on the local server running on the machine.

The main ones are a phpmyadmin page, a forum and a webmail

Looking at the forum and exploring the topics we found one called : "probleme login ?" from lmezard.
There is a huge text coming from what it looks like a log file of different access with everytime an
error for the password of the user.
But in the middle of the text, there is a weird string :

Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2

the !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ is a bit weird. This doesn't look like a username to me but more of a password.
Let's try to connect us on the machine. Trying with the different username found in the log : adam, admin, nagios, guest, ubnt, test, ftpuser

But nothing works to connect on the VM.
Remember we tried to login with the password : !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

We can connect on the forum too, let's try with the username we found and the same password. Same result, nothing works.

There is one last name we didn't try. The author of the original post : lmezard

And it works ! We can login on lmezard's account with the password : !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

Exploring the rest of the forum logged as lmezard we discovered that in our profile page, we have an email !

This email is : laurie@borntosec.net

So now we can login on the forum.
With dirb we found that there is a webmail service running on the machine : Squirrel Mail

Accessing https://[IP]/webmail

We need to input a username and a password.

Let's try the same username + password from the forum.
We are now connected on the email service and there are 2 emails on the account.

The first one'subject is "very interesting!!!" but the content of the email is not.
However the last one received is waaaaaaaay more interesting.

Here is the email :

"Subject:  	DB Access

Hey Laurie,

You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$

Best regards."

There is a login/password to connect to the database ?
With dirb we knew there is a phpmyadmin page, but we didn't have the username and password to log in.
Let's try with the one from the email.

It works ! We can connect to the phpmyadmin as root.

root : Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
