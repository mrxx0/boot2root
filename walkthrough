In the dirb result we found some url on the local server running on the machine.

The main ones are a phpmyadmin page, a forum and a webmail

Looking at the forum and exploring the topics we found one called : "probleme login ?" from lmezard.
There is a huge text coming from what it looks like a log file of different access with everytime an
error for the password of the user.
But in the middle of the text, there is a weird string :

Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2

the !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ is a bit weird. This doesn't look like a username to me but more of a password.
Let's try to connect us on the machine. Trying with the different username found in the log : adam, admin, nagios, guest, ubnt, test, ftpuser

But nothing works to connect on the VM.
Remember we tried to login with the password : !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

We can connect on the forum too, let's try with the username we found and the same password. Same result, nothing works.

There is one last name we didn't try. The author of the original post : lmezard

And it works ! We can login on lmezard's account with the password : !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ
